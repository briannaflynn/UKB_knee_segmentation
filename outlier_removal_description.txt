Outlier Removal Steps

Filtered by:

	* Removing participants who do not have White British Ancestry
	* Removing widths (pixel lengths on x axis) whose sample size was under 1 percent of the total sample size. Example: 37000 individuals, remove images whose width at a particular value of x is below 370 participants.
	* Removing Y values for each of the remaining values of X that fall outside of three standard deviations from the mean
	* Removing outliers from the remaining participants by using an interquartile range cutoff. Lower-bound = quartile_1 - 1.5 * IQR, upper-bound = quartile_3 + 1.5 * IQR for all measurements (e.g. quad_1_av, quad_all_av ...)
	
Counts remaining after each step can be found in the following files:
	* right_joint_space_1pct_x_z3_y_iqr_counts.csv
	* left_joint_space_1pct_x_z3_y_iqr_counts.csv
